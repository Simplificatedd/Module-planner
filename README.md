## 🔧 Features in Detail

### Multi-Semester Modules
Modules can span multiple semesters with intelligent placement:
- **Forward Filling**: Modules are placed in consecutive forward semesters when possible
- **Backward Filling**: If forward placement isn't possible, the module extends backward
- **Continued Modules**: Show as grayed-out placeholders in non-primary semesters

### Drag & Drop Logic
- **Semester Assignment**: Drag modules from the module bank to any semester
- **Re-assignment**: Move modules between semesters with automatic span recalculation
- **Trash Deletion**: Drag modules to the trash zone to remove them entirely
- **Edit Mode Protection**: Prevents accidental drags when in "Show All / Edit" mode

### Management Functions
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Destructive actions like "Clear ALL Modules" require confirmation
- **Smart Semester Deletion**: Prevents deletion of semesters containing primary modules
- **Tooltips**: Helpful tooltips explain each management function
